In *general*, the best place to find out more about me is my [personal website](https://richard.ng/) - but it's geared towards a non-technical audience.

So, my GitHub profile `README` (hi there!) is where I talk a bit more about what I've built and am building.

## Building for the planet

At [greenworkx](https://greenworkx.org), we’re building the talent portal, smart-matching AI and professional network for the 90% of green jobs that are skilled but accessible frontline trades.

## Building for play

Outside work, board games are a big source of entertainment and relaxation for me.

I occasionally build quick online multiplayer implementations of games (that already exist), to allow for e.g. playing remotely with friends.

> ℹ️ **They're not documented especially well**, since the main use case is "me, Richard, playing with people I know and can quickly explain the rules to".
>
> However, *if you already know the underlying board/card game* and have played games remotely before, I *hope* that the UI/UX is sufficiently intuitive for you to pick it up.

Here are a few of them:
- [⛏️ Temple des Schreckens](https://github.com/richardcrng/tempel-des-schreckens)
- [🪳 Cockroach Poker](https://github.com/richardcrng/cockroach-poker)
- [⏲️ Two Rooms and a Boom](https://github.com/richardcrng/2r1b)

*Other board games that I like:*
- *[Scythe](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/169786/scythe)*
- *[Race for the Galaxy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143/race-galaxy)*
