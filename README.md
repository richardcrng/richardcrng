# Building for the planet... and for play!

I'm Richard, co-founder and CTO of [greenworkx](https://greenworkx.org).

In *general*, the best place to find out more about me is my [personal website](https://richard.ng/)...

... but it's geared towards a non-technical audience!

So, my GitHub profile `README` (hi there!) is where I talk a bit more about what I've build and am building.
