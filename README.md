### Tech education x DE&I

Prior to greenworkx, my career focus was tech education crossed with DE&I, e.g.:
- **Head of Education at Academy**, where I built a global tech training programme for cohorts that are 50% female, 60%+ minority ethnic backgrounds and 30% Black
- **Multiverse software engineering coach**, where I trained school leavers and career changers as software engineers for large enterprises 
- **teacher trainer with Code Your Future**, where I created training for the volunteers who taught CYF's refugee and asylum seeker trainees
- **Black Codher software engineering instructor** for two cohorts (40+) Black women learning full-stack software engineering

## Open-source

### Riduce

> ðŸ‘» I'm the author of **[Riduce](https://github.com/richardcrng/riduce)**, an open-source library that replaces reducer boilerplate with two lines of code.
> 
> (Or: it *reduces* reducer boilerplate, and gets *rid* of it - hence, *Riducer* as a library name!)

Whether you're using `useReducer` or Redux, reducer boilerplate is tedious to learn, setup and maintain.

What if type-safe state management was quicker, easier and simpler?

[Riduce](https://github.com/richardcrng/riduce) is a library written to be:

- Strongly-typed, so your state stays predictable
- Trivial to scale as your state grows more complex
- Zero hassle, with just two lines of code...

... and one of the 2 lines to setup is an import.

```js
import riduce from 'riduce'

const [reducer, actions] = riduce(initialState)
```

That's it! Now you've got a type-safe reducer and arbitrary actions, with zero hassle.
